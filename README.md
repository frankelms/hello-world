# hello-world

Greetings, World!

My name is Matthew. I am a junior at Appalachian State University majoring in Computer Science. I really don't know what else to write here but I don't think it matters because that's not the point. So, bye.

That last edit was done for another class which was also taught by Dr. Fenwick. However, I ran through the tutorial again as a refresher because I don't remember much about Git and Github.
